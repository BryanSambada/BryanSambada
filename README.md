I am a business analyst and financial econometrician currently looking for jobs !

I’m a data-driven problem solver passionate about uncovering insights that connect numbers to real-world impact. With a background in Business Analytics and Financial Econometrics from Monash University, I love transforming complex data into clear stories that guide smarter decisions. I thrive at the intersection of analytics, innovation, and strategy, where data meets business purpose.

I’m endlessly curious about how data can shape the future of industries, from energy and finance to AI. When I’m not deep in datasets or dashboards, you’ll probably find me exploring new analytics tools, researching emerging technologies, or learning from projects that push boundaries.

Currently preparing to relocate to Australia under a 485 Graduate Visa, I’m excited to collaborate with forward-thinking teams who value creativity, precision, and continuous learning. Let’s build something meaningful with data.
